# TODOs

* Use more menues (think about new idea what to be placed there)
* International languages
* Rotary encoder to be debounced (german entprellen) - should be done with improved hardware circuit using capacitors and resistors
* Publish current circuit schema
* Version vor LCD with only 2x16?
* Version for Envy (sensors for gas and SHT for temperarture and humidity on board)

# DONE

* BMP180 following the datasheet has temperature and pressure, DHT22 has temperatire and humidity so we need both
  Can BMP180 completele replace DHT22 to reduce needed hardware? Maybe show alternative both sensors switchable via settings
